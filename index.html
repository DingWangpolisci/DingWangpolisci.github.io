                <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
                <p class="lead">Welcome! I’m Ding Wang, a Political Scientist Specializing in Political Behavior and American Politics.</p>
                <p>I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Riverside, in 2023, and I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Consortium on Electoral Democracy (C-Dem) at the University of Western Ontario. My research explores how local contexts and individual predispositions shape public opinion and electoral behavior, with a particular focus on democratic backsliding, political division, and inequality.</p>
                <p>My dissertation investigates how local economic inequality influences welfare preferences in the United States. Using geo-coded survey and administrative data, I analyze how local income inequality affects perceptions of inequality and, in turn, preferences for redistributive policies. This work contributes to ongoing conversations about inequality by shifting the focus from national to local contexts and by incorporating individuals' economic histories. My broader research interests include geospatial politics, political polarization, gender, and democratic norms, with published articles in journals like <em>Electoral Studies</em> and <em>Politics & Gender</em>.</p>
                <p>As an educator, I am committed to creating inclusive, student-centered learning environments. I have taught and assisted in a wide range of courses on political behavior, public opinion, and voting behavior, with a focus on connecting empirical research with real-world political issues. My teaching philosophy emphasizes active learning, critical thinking, and the inclusion of diverse perspectives, particularly those of historically marginalized communities. I have been recognized for my teaching excellence, receiving the 2023 Outstanding Teaching Assistant award from UC Riverside.</p>
                <p>In addition to my research and teaching, I have been actively involved in academic service, managing the UCR Identity and Politics Lab and participating as a discussant at numerous conferences. I am deeply committed to fostering collaboration and scholarly exchange within the academic community.</p>
                <p>Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time reading journal articles, taking walks in nature, and visiting local museums. I also love hanging out with my cat, Nibbles, who always provides some much-needed relaxation and companionship.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my website. Please feel free to explore my <a href="research.html">Research</a>, <a href="cv.html">CV</a>, <a href="teaching.html">Teaching</a>, and <a href="grants-services.html">Grants and Services</a> sections, and contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss research and collaboration opportunities.</p>
