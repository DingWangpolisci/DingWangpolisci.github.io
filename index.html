                <p class="lead">
                    I am Ding Wang, a political scientist specializing in political behavior, inequality, and contextual influences on public opinion.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Areas of Interest:</strong> Political Behavior; Economic Inequality; Immigration Politics; Gender and Politics; Subnational and Local Context Effects; Democratic Attitudes; Quantitative Methods.</p>

                <p>
                    My research examines how structural economic conditions and local political environments shape public attitudes, policy preferences, and patterns of political inequality. I focus in particular on how individuals interpret national debates through geographically situated experiences, arguing that economic pressures are experienced locally and filtered through contextual cues. One strand of my work investigates how subnational economic contexts—especially housing affordability, zoning regimes, and localized inequality—shape attitudes toward redistribution, immigration, and welfare policy. Using geocoded survey data linked to administrative and economic indicators, I employ multilevel modeling, quasi-experimental designs, and survey experiments to identify contextual effects and the mechanisms through which economic pressures translate into perceptions of threat, deservingness, and blame. This work bridges political economy and political psychology by demonstrating how material environments condition mass preferences in immigration and related policy domains.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A second strand of my research focuses on gender and politics, particularly the conditional nature of stereotyping, evaluation, and accountability. Rather than treating bias as fixed, I study how gendered expectations are activated by informational, institutional, and economic contexts. My work examines gendered candidate evaluations, economic accountability, and the strategic use of counter-stereotypic behavior by female politicians. Methodologically, this research integrates survey experiments, conjoint designs, and large-scale observational data to identify when gender stereotypes become politically consequential and how contextual signals moderate voter judgment. Across both strands, I emphasize causal inference, careful measurement, and reproducible workflows, drawing on advanced training in experimental design, multilevel modeling, geospatial analysis, and survey methodology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My research has been published in <em>Electoral Studies</em> and <em>Politics & Gender</em>, and I maintain active projects on immigration attitudes, housing politics, far-right representation, and democratic norms. I work primarily with survey and experimental data and am proficient in R, Stata, and Python for statistical modeling, geocoding, visualization, and fully reproducible research design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have taught courses in political behavior, American politics, comparative politics, and research methods at the University of California, Riverside. As an Associate Instructor, I have led courses on American Politics, Elections and Political Participation, and Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration. I am deeply committed to integrating empirical evidence into the classroom, helping students connect rigorous research designs with real-world political debates. My teaching emphasizes critical evaluation of evidence, methodological literacy, and the application of quantitative findings to substantive political questions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to research and teaching, I have experience managing collaborative research teams, supervising research assistants, and contributing to multi-project data initiatives. I am committed to transparency, preregistration, and fully reproducible workflows in both independent and team-based research.
                </p>
